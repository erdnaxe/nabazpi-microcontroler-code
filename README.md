# NabazPi Microcontroler code
Inspired by : https://github.com/ccarlo64/nabaztag_raspberry/

## Connections
On an Arduino NANO :

	RFID Reader (I2C) :
	 Brown -> 5V
	 Red -> GND
	 Orange -> A4 (SDA)
	 Yellow -> A5 (SCL)

	Top button :
	 White -> GND
	 Grey -> D2

	Volume wheel :
	 Brown -> GND
	 Red -> A7
	 Orange -> 5V


## Libraries
The project uses **Wire** and **Pushbutton**.

**Wire** is included with the Arduino software.

**Pushbutton** can be installed within the Arduino software, in "Manage Librairies...".


## WIP
This is totally Work In Progress.
